# Snippet Essentials

An ultimate collection of more than 700 snippets for C#.

### How It Works

Snippet Essentials contains hundreds of snippets. Rather than memorizing snippets shortcuts, Snippet Essentials introduces framework that is used to construct snippet shortcut. This framework consists of single characters or character sequences where each character or character sequence represents particular language element.
